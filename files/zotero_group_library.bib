	abstract = {Computational screening metrics through which the additive manufacturability of novel refractory high-entropy alloys can be rapidly assessed are investigated, with a focus on laser powder bed fusion. The rapid heating and cooling experienced in both laser powder bed fusion and laser directed energy deposition additive manufacturing techniques result in a processing regime that differs from conventional casting- and welding-based hot crack susceptibility metrics. Calculation of phase diagrams ({CALPHAD}) is used to predict possible phases, alloy compositions, and freezing ranges for a database of 100 alloys published in the literature, and it is shown that several established metrics can differ substantially from one another. A new additive manufacturing cracking susceptibility criterion is proposed, based on Pearson correlation with cumulative crack lengths observed in laser glaze experiments on selected alloys. Equilibrium freezing range was most correlated with cumulative crack length (Pearson r = 0.89), followed by the Scheil freezing range (r = 0.84) and Pugh’s G/B ratio (r = – 0.90). Combined metrics, such as further improved predictive capability with correlations. Established crack susceptibility indices like Kou {CSI} (r = 0.54) and Clyne {CSC} (r = -0.86) were found to be less predictive for {RHEAs} under {LPBF} conditions.},

The present research investigates the differences in hot cracking behavior among four refractory high-entropy compositions that show inconsistencies in their predicted cracking susceptibility according to different indicators, including the freezing range, Clyne cracking susceptibility criterion, and Kou cracking susceptibility index. Hot cracking behavior is assessed using laser glazing at two laser powers and eight different laser scan speeds for arc-melted alloy pairs. Cracking susceptibility differences and melt pool behavior are quantified and compared for key alloy pairs and assessed in the context of the strengths and limitations of cracking susceptibility indicators.},

	abstract = {The formation of Nb2O5 and other oxides in {NbTi}–X (X = 5Co, 10Cr, 10Ni, 10CoCrNi) after exposure to 800 °C accelerates oxidation kinetics, shifting from a parabolic rate law to a power-law exponent of two at 1200 °C. Subsequent oxidation at 800 °C for material initially exposed to oxidation at 1200 °C shows that the retained {TiNb}2O7 and {CrNbO}4 oxide scale substantially improves oxidation kinetics, transitioning from linear to parabolic behavior at this temperature. The oxide scales were heterogeneous, exhibiting regions with thin oxide layers alongside areas of thick, porous scales due to the formation of discontinuous metal and complex oxide structures. Microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) revealed that the formation of metal oxides and complex oxides plays a crucial role in oxidation resistance. In alloys containing Co and Ni, {TiNb}2O7 and Nb2O5 layers are observed. Additionally, {NbTi}–10({CoCrNi}) exhibited significant internal corrosion zones composed of various oxides. Quantitative X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) analysis of the oxide scales formed after 16 hours of oxidation confirmed that Nb2O5 and {TiO}2 were the predominant phases when oxidation resistance is relatively poor and {TiNb}2O7 and {CrNbO}4 are present when oxidation weight gain rates are comparatively lower. Furthermore, it is found that these alloys exhibit low, stable thermal expansion, with hysteresis primarily in the as-cast state due to phase transitions and internal stresses, which largely disappear after homogenization due to single-phase stability and reduced partitioning effects. These findings may provide valuable insights into the oxidation behavior, structural evolution, and thermal stability of these alloys, particularly in environments involving thermal cycling between high and low temperatures.},

	volume = {in press},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14127},
	abstract = {Designing shape memory alloys ({SMAs}) that meet performance targets while remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we focus on optimizing {SMA} compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer ({COBYLA}), while the neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a gradient-based optimizer ({TRUST}-{CONSTR}). Our results show that while both models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural network finds better solutions more consistently. {COBYLA} often converged to suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target. The {TRUST}-{CONSTR} method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a practical approach to exploring new {SMA} compositions by combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be made with limited data.},

	abstract = {We employ density functional theory ({DFT}) to examine the vibrational, electronic, and ion transport properties of Nb2C and Nb2CO2 {MXenes} as potential anode materials for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. For the first time, we simulate the Raman spectra of pristine and Li/Na-intercalated Nb2C, as well as Nb2CO2, to evaluate structural response and its correlation with charge transfer. The predicted Raman modes reproduce known experimental peaks in Nb2C, persistent upon intercalation. Raman peak positions remain unchanged with ion insertion indicating minimal structural distortion. We observed variations in peak intensities indicating modifications in polarizability due to charge transfer and altered electron phonon coupling. Our analysis confirms that both {MXenes} retain metallic conductivity after intercalation, ensuring efficient electron transport. Adsorption energy calculations identify the T4 and H3 sites as favorable for Li/Na, with Nb2CO2 exhibiting stronger binding due to surface oxygen terminations. Diffusion barrier analysis reveals enhanced ion mobility in Nb2C, particularly for Na ions, while Nb2CO2 delivers higher open-circuit voltage and stronger ion retention. This study demonstrates the utility of Raman spectroscopy, coupled with first-principles simulations, as a predictive tool for probing structural and electronic behavior in energy materials. Our findings position Nb2C for fast-charging applications and Nb2CO2 for high-energy-density systems.},

	abstract = {The desire to be able to tailor transformation temperatures in shape memory alloys has led to widespread interest in applying machine learning ({ML}) to optimization of alloy compositions. Some research has indicated that augmentation of training datasets with physics-based predictors can improve accuracy of {ML} models. The present study tests this hypothesis for multiple decision tree-based models, training them on a comprehensive dataset of over 7000 alloys. The Extra Trees Regressor ({ETR}) was found to achieve the highest accuracy with an R2 value of 0.8743, effectively reproducing non-linear relationships between composition and transformation temperatures. Inclusion of certain physics-based parameters is found to improve accuracy over composition alone, with R2 value of 0.93. In agreement with prior published work, the model performance is further improved by integrating processing information. With the inclusion of both physics-based predictors and processing information in the {ML} model, an R2 value of 0.99 can be reached.},

Niobium (Nb) addition at atomic concentrations of x= 9\%, 23\%, and 37\% were investigated to discern their influence on the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), all while sustaining a nearly constant Valence Electron Concentration ({VEC}) of 4.9. This approach challenges the prevalent assumption of {VEC}'s correlation with the Tc, aiming to identify potential deviations. Button specimens, cast via vacuum arc melting, underwent electrical resistivity assessments at varied temperatures, utilizing a Quantum Design {DynaCool} system.

The relationship between mass gain, oxide thickness, and oxide color was characterized as a function of heat treatment time and temperature. It is anticipated that a model relating oxide thickness to heat treatment conditions will help improve standards for welding and additive manufacturing of Ti64 in the future.},

	abstract = {Refractory high entropy alloys ({RHEAs}) have received significant attention for their remarkable  strength at very high temperatures. However, even for ductile compositions, conventional thermomechanical processing remains extremely challenging due to the very same high temperature strength properties that make this family of alloys interesting for extreme environment applications. Many researchers have proposed additive manufacturing as a potential solution for fabrication of components as a possible route for taking advantage of {RHEA} properties. This paper investigates screening metrics through which the additive manufacturability of {RHEAs} can be assessed, with a focus on laser powder bed fusion. Crack susceptibility criteria are calculated using parameters derived from a calculation of phase diagrams ({CALPHAD}) approach, using commercially available databases. Solidification predictions are used to predict possible phases, alloy compositions, and freezing ranges for a database of alloys published in the literature. It is found that different castability metrics can differ substantially from one another. The computational predictions are then assessed using laser glazing at two laser powers and eight laser scan speeds for arc melted alloy pairs at opposite extremes of the solidification crack susceptibility and castability metrics. Cracking susceptibility differences and melt pool behavior are quantified and compared for key alloy pairs, and the correlation between crack propagation and microstructure are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. An assessment of future prospects for additive manufacturing processability prediction for refractory high entropy alloys will be presented, along with observations relevant to alloy design strategies for solidification crack tolerant complex compositions of refractory alloys.},

In this work, we investigate methods for multi-objective optimization of {SMA} compositions to achieve an arbitrary target martensitic start temperature (Ms) while
minimizing cost. We trained two machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a
neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and
physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free
optimizer ({COBYLA}), while the neural network was paired with a gradient-based optimizer ({TRUST}-{CONSTR}). Though the tree-based ensemble exhibits slightly better accuracy, gradient-based optimization on the neural network is more consistent at finding optimal solutions, whereas derivative-free
optimization on the trees model often converges to suboptimal results. The present study demonstrates some practical limitations to using machine learning models
for composition optimization as well as a viable approach which can be extended to
other materials.},

	abstract = {The prior austenite grain ({PAG}) size of a low alloy high strength martensitic steel, {AF}9628, was refined by rapid austenitizing heat treatments at 825 and 850 °C. The reduction in {PAG} size of as high as 97\% was obtained. After one rapid austenitizing cycle, the newly nucleated (small) {PAGs} were observed to be preferentially located at the prior austenite grain boundaries of starting microstructure, although a small number of fine {PAGs} were also observed in the interior of {PAGs} of starting microstructure. A more uniform distribution of fine {PAGs} was observed with an increase in the number of cycles. The average number of austenite nucleation sites in a given area was 43.4\% higher at 850 °C than 825 °C after one cycle. A higher nucleation rate at 850 °C resulted in a smaller {PAG} size at this temperature than 825 °C after one and four cycles. A higher growth rate at 850 °C resulted in a larger {PAG} size at this temperature than 825 °C after sixteen cycles. Prior studies have discussed the role of growth rate in microstructure evolution during rapid austenitizing heat treatments at different temperatures and not the role of nucleation rate, which is discussed for the first time in current study. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction results indicated a higher amount of retained austenite in the finest microstructure and it can affect the strength in these microstructures. This aspect of microstructure evolution is also not reported in prior studies on microstructural refinement with rapid austenitizing method.},

It is important to understand this mechanism because it offers insights into grain size control, which is critical to the tensile, fatigue, and creep properties of superalloys. In this paper, {HeRX} activity in the low solvus high refractory ({LSHR}) is quantitatively characterized using combined energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron backscatter diffraction. The formation of heteroepitaxially recrystallized grains is observed within the intermediate-misfit γ–γ′ superalloy {LSHR}; this suggests the {HeRX} is more widespread than initially thought. Microstructural imaging indicates that the presence of a coherent γ shell formed via inverse precipitation is not a necessary condition for the nucleation of {HeRX} grains. {HeRX} grains are found to comprise the large grain tail of the grain size distribution, regardless of processing condition. The extent of {HeRX} grain formation and growth in {LSHR} is determined as a function of strain, forging rate, and thermal history.},

Despite nearly a century of the existence of standards for measuring grain size, issues persist in obtaining consistent grain size measurements across several techniques. Of particular interest is comparing optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy on an etched surface with mapping of crystal orientations using electron backscatter diffraction ({EBSD}). In this work, discrepancies between methods in the {ASTM} E 112 and {ASTM} E 2627 standards are explored through simulated measurements on synthetic microstructures. It is concluded that a small but systematic discrepancy exists between planimetric and lineal intercept-based approaches, and a new empirical relationship between the {ASTM} grain size number G and lineal intercepts is proposed.},

Recent experiments and simulations have highlighted the unusual deformation behavior of an equiatomic {MoNbTi} alloy, which exhibits slip on higher order planes and sluggish edge dislocation mobility. In this work, we utilize micropillar compression and postmortem transmission electron microscopy to elucidate the orientation dependent deformation behavior of {MoNbTi}. Our results suggest that deformation in this system is largely mediated by kink-migration of screw dislocations, as evidenced by the presence of long screw dislocations and significant dislocation debris in postmortem observations, and the absence of twinning/anti-twinning asymmetry. Moreover, we report an unusual orientation dependence of the yield strength, owing to the high stress required to facilitate slip on \{110\} type planes. These results further demonstrate the unconventional plasticity in {BCC} {RMPEAs}, and provide experimental verification that kink-migration is the rate limiting feature in this alloy at low temperatures.},

It is well known that alloys with Ni concentrations below 28.5 at.\% exhibit lath martensite ({LM}) microstructures (athermal transformation, small crystals, accommodation by dislocations). Above this concentration, plate martensite ({PM}) forms (burst-like transformation, large crystals, accommodation by twins). The present work is based on a combination of (i) ingot metallurgy for the manufacturing of Fe-Ni alloys with varying Ni-concentrations, (ii) thermal analysis to measure phase transformation temperatures with a special focus on {MS}, and (iii) analytical orientation imaging scanning electron microscopy for a quantitative description of microstructures and crystallographic features. For Ni-concentrations close to 28.5 at.\%, the descending {MS}-curve shows a local maximum, which has been overlooked in prior works. Beyond the local maximum, {MS} temperatures decrease again and follow the overall trend. The local maximum is associated with the formation of transition martensite ({TM}) microstructure, which exhibits {LM} and {PM} features. {TM} forms at higher {MS} temperatures, as it is accommodated by simultaneous twinning and dislocation slip. An adopted version of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation explains the correlation between simultaneous accommodation and increased transformation temperatures.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes the current state of understanding related to cold dwell fatigue ({CDF}) of titanium alloys, which is a failure mechanism that can lead to uncontained failure of rotating components. Jet engine manufacturers have brought forward their collective field and spin rig experience related to {CDF} and coupled it with a thorough literature review to offer an aviation industry perspective on this critical safety issue. Numerous factors are known to influence susceptibility to {CDF} including intrinsic factors like alloy composition, microstructure, and residual stress as well as extrinsic factors like applied stress, dwell time, and temperature. Of particular importance is the presence of microtextured regions ({MTRs}) present in the material. Definitions and best practices for characterizing this microstructural feature are proposed. The mechanisms of damage accumulation, early crack nucleation, and rapid crack propagation through {MTRs} during {CDF} are reviewed along with additional effects of microtexture on material properties including conventional fatigue, sustained load cracking, and stress corrosion cracking. The microstructural condition of finished components depends on the details of billet processing, component forging, and heat treatment practice. The mechanisms of microstructure evolution at each step of the process are summarized and directional guidance is given relative to important factors controlling {MTR} and alpha colony formation. Laboratory coupon testing, accelerated tests for dwell sensitivity, and aspects of specimen versus component behavior are discussed. Multiple pathways that lead to {CDF} failure are summarized and strategies to mitigate the risk of {CDF} are highlighted including aspects of alloy composition, processing/microstructure relationships, design, and nondestructive inspection. This report concludes with identification of directions for further research. Several appendices are provided which summarize major research programs related to {CDF} and additional methods to characterize {MTRs} using destructive and nondestructive evaluations methods.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of billions of dollars are currently being invested by many countries around the world to develop domestic manufacturing capabilities to achieve their clean energy and decarbonization goals. Electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, microchips, and many carbon capture devices are dependent on minerals that are of limited availability worldwide. Many of these technologies are also steel and concrete intensive in their installations. Steel and concrete are counted among the most greatest decarbonization challenges the world faces. The adoption of hydrogen for industrial heating and reduction processes presents a risk to present steel-dominated transportation and storage infrastructure. Thus, humanity is faced with a conundrum: Many materials upon which we are dependent for addressing climate change are themselves substantial contributors to {CO}2 emissions. Shifting our economies from fuel-based to materials-based systems will require intensive mining of minerals for which the world’s supply is limited, as well as construction of new buildings, manufacturing capabilities, and infrastructure. Furthermore, the rapid introduction of different specialty alloy grades over the past 40 years (responsible for significant improvements in safety and performance) presents a challenge for the creation of sustainable circular economies. This talk will explore the geopolitical, national security, economic security, and climate implications of a ‘green gold rush’ on secondary processing of metallic materials. It will trace the supply chains of a few regionally important critical materials from where they are mined through their role in alloys critical for the energy and economic security. Tools and prospects for sustainable metallurgy will be presented, along with some select basic science gaps that could be collaboratively addressed to the benefit of the international economy, climate, and society.},

	abstract = {{NbTi}-based refractory alloys with additions of Co, Cr, and Ni represent an interesting medium-entropy alloy system with potential for protective oxide film formation, high strength, and ductility. This study investigates the microstructural evolution, oxidation behavior, and mechanical properties of {NbTi}-based alloys containing 5 to 10 at. pct Co, Cr, and Ni. {CALPHAD} predictions suggest that this composition range can be heat treated to obtain a predominantly body-centered cubic matrix phase. Mechanical properties, including microhardness, yield strength, maximum strength, and specific strength are evaluated through isothermal compression tests conducted between room temperature and 800 °C. The oxidation kinetics of these alloys are assessed through discontinuous oxidation tests. Parabolic oxidation kinetics were observed for {NbTi}–10Ni and {NbTi}–5Co, while linear oxidation kinetics were found for {NbTi}–10Cr and {NbTi}–10({CoCrNi}). Microstructures and oxide layers are characterized using X-ray diffraction, electron backscatter diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. All alloys exhibit significant mechanical softening between room temperature and 800 °C, with elastic-perfectly plastic flow observed at 800 °C. The addition of 10 pct Cr to {NbTi} resulted in two {BCC} phases up to 1050 °C, conflicting with {CALPHAD} predictions of a single-phase solid solution at this temperature, and resulting in higher flow stress at 800 °C. {NbTi}–10({CoCrNi}) exhibited the lowest flow stress at 800 °C despite having more ‘cocktail effect’ potential and insufficient molar fractions of Co, Cr, or Ni to form a desirable protective oxide film.},

	doi = {10.1007/s40192-025-00403-8},
	abstract = {Established indexes for predicting hot cracking susceptibility exhibit limited agreement with experiments for additive manufacturing of new refractory alloys. A recent publication from Giorjao et al. proposes a new index based on the physics of liquid feeding into the interdendritic channels. Laminar flow simulations are performed with the Scheil solidification profile mirrored about a central axis, creating a funnel which is assumed can represent the interdendritic wall geometry. The pressure difference developed from flow in this geometry is hypothesized to correlate with cracking susceptibility, as it is expected that this parameter should scale with the ability of the interdendritic liquid to backfill shrinkage porosity. The approach has the advantage of utilizing parameters that can be predicted using {CALPHAD} software and databases; however, it exhibits a drawback that pressure drop is a function of geometry and simulation scale. In the present work, sensitivity studies were performed on geometric and viscosity parameters. An alternative to the constant flow rate assumption used by Giorjao et al. is proposed, in which the flow rate that results from the pressure difference imposed by solidification shrinkage is used as the crack susceptibility criterion. Results are subsequently compared to laser glazing experiments on four {RHEAs}, a set of stainless steels, and several Al alloys. It is found that the constant flow rate assumption produces better agreement with experiments than the model with a physics-based feeding pressure. Observations are discussed in the context of current literature and physical understanding of solidification in additive manufacturing.},

Additionally, Voronoi tessellations offer limited control of morphological parameters and are challenging to implement when the desired volume fraction is less than unity. However, unless additional physics-based constraints are applied, growth on a Cartesian voxel grid utilizing a von Neumann neighborhood element results in anisotropic growth that is generally not observable along the primary axes. The present work describes both analytical and empirically optimized corrections for directional growth rates and a framework for their inclusion in a synthetic microstructure generation algorithm. The presented algorithm can produce synthetic microstructures similar to those produced by random seed Monte Carlo techniques in a fraction of the computational time.},

	abstract = {Improper welding of Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) can lead to both surface oxidation and oxygen diffusion into the bulk, known as alpha case. Given the applications of Ti64 in critical structures, particularly in the aerospace domain, stringent guidelines are followed to determine weld acceptability. These are largely based on visual inspection of the color presented in the weld’s heat-affected zone. In the present work, we analyze {LCh} color space data acquired through spectrophotometry of thermally oxidized Ti64 samples to determine the relationship of surface color with oxide layer thickness and alpha case depth. Samples were exposed for 2-210 minutes at temperatures ranging from 482-900°C. Surface color values were quantified, and cross-sectional microstructures were analyzed. Results show a correlation between the growth rates of the oxide and alpha case layers for oxide thicknesses greater than 0.5 microns, and a relationship between color and oxide thickness below 0.6 microns. Furthermore, the surface color was observed to transition through several repetitive cycles – called orders – before reaching a final, limiting color. While surface color has long been used to predict titanium weld quality, these standards do not consider the important cyclic nature of the color transitions, leading to the potential acceptance of substandard welds.},

Microstructure was characterized before and after deformation under different conditions. Nonlinear optimization algorithms were employed to compare and contrast microstructure-aware and phenomenological (microstructure-unaware) relationships for flow behavior, aiming to develop a new subroutine for {FEM} prediction of closed-die forging.

Recent studies have explored multi-material designs involving dissimilar metals with and without interlayers, leveraging both L-{PBF} and {DED}. In this work, we propose a novel framework for material selection in the {AM} of graded structures. It is found that the order of materials used in {AM} is critically important due to the effects of laser absorption and thermal mismatch strains. Additionally, the order of {AM} modalities provides a strategy for microstructure manipulation because the rapid cooling rates with L-{PBF} induce strong solute trapping effects whereas {DED} typically produces larger melt pools, enabling uniform constituent mixing.},

Functions were developed to calculate and visualize physical properties such as viscosity and phase fractions to see if alloys will become brittle, and data was used to show some metals may compromise the integrity of others when co-recycled. Computational tools can reduce the time required to perform calculations.

	url = {https://www.matscitech.org/MST24},
	abstract = {Compressive residual stresses induced by surface modification techniques such as Ultrasonic Nanocrystal Surface Modification ({UNSM}) and Laser Shock Peening ({LSP}) are known to improve fatigue lives through inhibition of fatigue crack initiation and growth. Thermomechanical processing often results in substantial crystallographic texture development in Ti-6Al-4V, a workhorse alloy in the aerospace industry. This study investigates the effects of the crystallographic texture and microstructure from plate rolling of Ti-6Al-4V on the depth and intensity of compressive residual stresses formed by {UNSM} and {LSP} treatments. Texture and residual stress are characterized using X-ray diffraction, while microstructure has been characterized using electron backscatter diffraction, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The potential implications of crystallographic texture on fatigue performance are discussed in the context of prior publications on the effect of surface residual stress on fatigue behavior of Ti-6Al-4V.},

	abstract = {Phase field is an important approach for simulating microstructure evolution at the mesoscale. Within the domain of polycrystalline metals, vacancy transport exerts a clear influence on microstructural changes. The vacancy dynamics and pore nucleation in the Ni-Ti alloy system are explained by the sharp interface phase field model. This research aims to simulate and understand the formation and evolution of Kirkendall pores near the center of Ti-coated Ni wires during interdiffusion, resulting in the creation of {NiTi} shape memory alloy microtubes. The sharp interface model was implemented in multiphysics software and different boundary conditions were explored to gain a greater understanding of the pore nucleation process that leads to microtube formation. The role of various simulation conditions in producing agreements and discrepancies with experimental observations will be discussed, along with prospects for connecting {CALPHAD} mobility databases to multiphysics software to investigate other alloy systems.},

	abstract = {Refractory high entropy alloys ({RHEAs}) have received significant attention for their remarkable  strength at very high temperatures. However, even for ductile compositions, conventional thermomechanical processing remains extremely challenging due to the very same high temperature strength properties that make this family of alloys interesting for extreme environment applications. Many researchers have proposed additive manufacturing as a potential solution for fabrication of components as a possible route for taking advantage of {RHEA} properties. This talk will critically assess screening metrics for the relative hot cracking susceptibility of {RHEAs} under rapid cooling conditions experienced in additive manufacturing, with a focus on laser powder bed fusion. Crack susceptibility criteria are calculated using parameters derived from a calculation of phase diagrams ({CALPHAD}) approach, using commercially available databases. Solidification predictions are used to predict possible phases, alloy compositions, and freezing ranges for a database of alloys published in the literature. It is found that castability metrics can differ substantially from one another. Computational predictions are then assessed using laser glazing at two laser powers and eight laser scan speeds for arc melted alloy pairs at opposite extremes of the solidification crack susceptibility and castability metrics. Cracking susceptibility differences and melt pool behavior are quantified and compared for key alloy pairs, and the correlation between crack propagation and microstructure are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. An assessment of future prospects for additive manufacturing processability prediction for refractory high entropy alloys will be presented, along with observations relevant to alloy design strategies for solidification crack tolerant complex compositions of refractory alloys.},

	abstract = {Hybrid additive manufacturing ({AM}) combines {AM} technology with other conventional manufacturing techniques to complement the strengths of the different processes. Many studies have relied on tensile tests for predicting the interface strength. This can obscure the non-uniform deformation of
hybrid manufactured bulk materials. In this work, the 3-point bend test was used
to assess interfacial strength. The results demonstrated that the loading side
and positioning of the {AM} region had a substantial influence on joint strength. Flexural strength increased when the {AM} side is in compression. The wrought side under tension inhibited crack growth, preventing sample separation. Conversely, when the wrought side is in compression, the flexural strength
decreased, and the sample fractured due to lower fracture toughness of the
{AM} region. Microstructure investigation revealed a mixture of fine equiaxed
and martensitic grains along the interface, coarse equiaxed elongated grains in wrought Ti64, and fully martensitic grains in {DED} Ti64.},

This research investigates how the correlation of measured {ORs} in different steel weld regions can be utilized to predict thermal history. Crystallographic variants are characterized using {EBSD} while the orientation relationship is analyzed within the {MTEX} {MATLAB} toolbox.

employed to synthesize refractory metal carbides based on Mo, Nb, and V as {MXene}
precursors. By modulating the partial pressures of H₂ and {CH}₄, the stoichiometry of the resulting carbide crystals was manipulated. A
thermodynamic analysis was performed to assess stability and predict the
formation of carbides. The synthesis products were characterized using Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction data, which confirmed the successful formation of carbides under various {CVD} conditions. Discrepancy between experimentally observed carbides and thermodynamic analysis will be discussed. The results provide valuable insight into {CVD} as a method for {MXene} synthesis.},

	abstract = {In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to explore the potential of 2D-Nb2C and Nb2CO2 {MXenes} as anode materials for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries. Our study reveals that Li/Na intercalation induces electronic changes without significant structural distortion, as indicated by Raman spectra. Adsorption energy calculations show T4 and H3 as the most favorable sites for Nb2C and Nb2CO2, respectively, with stronger adsorption observed in oxygen-functionalized two dimensional Nb2CO2. Diffusion barrier analyses highlight a trade-off between ion mobility and adsorption stability. While Nb2CO2 ensures better charge retention due to strong adsorption and higher open circuit voltages, Nb₂C offers lower diffusion barriers—especially for Na—favoring fast ion transport. Bader charge analysis underscores the role of oxygen functionalization in enhancing charge transfer but increasing migration resistance. Electronic structure results confirm the metallic nature of both {MXenes}, with dominant Nb(d) contributions facilitating efficient electron transport. Despite Li-based systems achieving higher theoretical capacities, Na-based systems show competitive performance, particularly with Nb2C, offering a low-cost and sustainable alternative. Our findings provide critical insights into the design of next-generation anode materials, emphasizing surface engineering to optimize performance for scalable energy storage technologies.},

between 0.001/s and 1.0/s using strain rate jump compression tests on a Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical tester. Nonlinear optimization is used to fit model parameters to the experimental observations. Several constitutive models are considered, including Johnson-Cook, Power law, and Arrhenius-type. The Lin-Wagoner model provides an accurate reproduction of the stress-strain behavior under transient strain rate conditions if the “A” parameter (corresponding to yield strength at the reference condition) is allowed to vary linearly with temperature. The flow stress response is rationalized through characterization of microstructure after deformation under different strain rate and temperature conditions.},

	abstract = {Hf–Ta alloys have recently received much attention due to their favorable oxidation resistance and mechanical properties at temperatures beyond 1200 °C. However, at lower temperatures the oxidation resistance becomes poor and the alloys experience brittle to ductile transition. Both effects are likely due to their two-phase structure formed during eutectoid transformation. In the present work, we report mechanical properties and oxidation behavior of Hf-27\%Ta and Hf-42\%Ta (compositions are in atomic percent), which experience eutectoid transformation at ∼1083 °C and contain two phases, Hf-rich {HCP} and Ta-rich {BCC}, below this temperature. Alloys of the compositions corresponding to these two eutectoid phases, Hf-90\%Ta ({BCC}) and Hf-3\%Ta ({HCP}), were also produced and studied for comparison. The results show that in the temperature range of 25–1000 °C (i.e., below the eutectoid transformation) the compression strengths of Hf-90\%Ta and Hf-3\%Ta are considerably smaller than the strength of Hf-27\%Ta or Hf-42\%Ta, while above the eutectoid transformation, where the Hf-27\%Ta and Hf-42\%Ta alloys have single-phase {BCC} structures, the Hf-90\%Ta and Hf-3\%Ta become stronger than either Hf-27\%Ta or Hf-42\%Ta. It was concluded that the interfaces in the eutectoid structure of Hf-27\%Ta produce considerable strengthening, which can exceed the strengths of the phases which comprise the microstructure. At 800 °C and 1000 °C, Hf-90\%Ta oxidized rapidly in comparison to Hf-3\%Ta due to the extensive formation of Ta2O5. It is suggested that the observed poor oxidation behavior of Hf-27\%Ta below the temperature of the eutectoid transformation is likely controlled by the oxidation kinetics of the Hf-90\%Ta {BCC} phase in the eutectoid structure of this alloy.},
