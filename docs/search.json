    "text": "You’ve managed to find an Easter Egg!\nThe last major wave of the Europe’s bubonic plague pandemic hit London in 1665. Cambridge University shut down as a precautiouary measure, and one of its students, Isaac Newton, retreated to his mother’s countryside home in Woolsthorpe. It was during this time that he developed the mathematical theories that later became calculus, and he developed his theories on optics and gravitation. In the same year, Robert Hooke published Micrographia, establishing the new science of microscopy and coining the word “cell.” It was a year that is well deserving of the title annus mirabilis. Isaac Newton’s Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica tore down curtains of superstition about the way the world works, and Robert Hooke’s Micrographia established techniques that we now follow for making observations to draw physical conclusions about the way materials behave. Coincidentally, this is also the year in which John Lenhall published the first deck of cards designed specifically for cartomancy.\nThe decision to pursue graduate studies should not be taken lightly. The initial excitement of the opportunity will inevitably give way to strains as you challenge yourself, confronting multiple stressors simultaneously. Expanding your horizons changes your mind irreversibly. When you complete your graduate journey, you will find yourself transformed. You will not only gain deep knowledge about a specific topic, but you should develop skills in communicating, thinking critically, paying attention to detail, managing your time and efforts, understanding the roles of power and incentive structures in people’s motivations, ethical behaviors and responsibilities, how technical progress can be accelerated toward a societal need, and much more. I take my role as a mentor and advisor in this journey very seriously, and I treat our research meetings as a weekly seminar covering topics in which you should be informed in your journey to become a scientist. I call this “the process” in homage to Sam Hinkie. Scientific training is a process. You have to Trust the Process. I meet with researchers in the Critical Alloy Research & Discovery (CARD) lab twice most weeks. The university calendar has 15 weeks for each of 3 semesters in which students in the CARD lab enroll in research credits, leaving a remainder of 7. We also meet in most of these seven weeks that fall outside of the course enrollment periods. The process can’t easily conform to the university academic calendar. There are 52 weeks in a year and 52 cards in a standard deck. 13 cards for each of four seasons.\nI came up with the acronym “CARD” for our lab before I tried to find a connection to cards the physical objects. I brainstormed many much more complicated acronyms first before settling on CARD. For years before returning to academia, I described my research areas as threefold: (1) metals processing science; (2) alloy discovery and design; and (3) microstructure metrology. The first two cannot be done without the third. As I returned to academia, I wanted to concentrate my research focus on materials that were critical for economic and energy security, explicitly acknowledging the role that supply chain complexity and economic relationships play in determining what is critical, for whom, when, and where. As materials engineers, our role in the ecosystem mostly addresses how and why through incremental progress in design. As materials scientists, our objective is to understand the physics that can be used to unlock disruptive changes in criticality.\nMy observation is that the greater context of why we are motivated to perform research, why societies financially support research, and the broader impacts of making the graduate education journey are often neglected in graduate studies in favor of strict focus on deep technical aspects. Understanding the social powers that guide research directions and developing technical depth are not mutually exclusive. The division between social science and physical science is a false choice. The Process in the CARD lab encourages students to gain breadth in both while they develop depth in the physics of materials and microstructure metrology.\nI like the contrast between the mystical superstition represented by cartomancy and the Newtonian rationality of the process. It serves as a reminder of where humanity has come from intellectually, and where enlightenment has taken us. To represent The Process of transformation through graduate studies in the CARD lab, I have carefully chosen some card sequences from cartomancy.1"

Employing state-of-the-art computational and quantitative characterization techniques, his group seeks to lend insights into microstructure evolution during processing and chemo-mechanical environmental interactions in service, then use this knowledge to develop practical tools for predicting material properties. Prior to joining the faculty of the University of Cincinnati in 2022, Dr. Payton served for five years as the Research Leader for the Metallic Materials and Processing Team at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate. Before entering government service, he was an Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, and held post-doctoral positions at both Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany and the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) in Berlin, Germany. He obtained his doctorate in Materials Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University. Dr. Payton’s colleagues suspect he would be a good addition to their trivia night team; however, his area of trivia mastery may be limited to turn-of-the century musicians. Dr. Payton is an enthusiastic advocate of scientific collaboration, structured programming, learner-centered pedagogy, and vegetables.\nThe PI’s complete list of publications (including those prior to establishing the CARD Lab) can be found at  zotero.org/paytone or  orcid.org/0000-0001-7478-9372.",
